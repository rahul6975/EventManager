- [Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
- [Android Architecture Components](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture) - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
  - [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata) - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.

  - [ViewBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/view-binding) - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
  - [DataBinding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding) - The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.
